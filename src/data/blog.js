            This will be my first blog post, just want to post my thoughts here.
            I would like to journal daily, we will see how that goes. Blah blah blah blah, need to fill this up a bit, I will leave you with a poem I wrote a bit ago:
            >>poem
            Da Grey Beneath
            Blue black infinity,\n
            Shadows in your trenches,\n
            humanity's greatest fear,\n
            a trove of friendship

            Today will be cloudy all day.\n
            Will try to watch the Spain vs France game, work willing. Odds are slightly in favor of Spain (+170 vs +200), I predict a 1-0 win for them.\n
            Want to use my Gomu Planner app a bit more today to plan. I will have to review the logs at night to get the full benefits as well. I am writing this down so I will work out today, at least at my home gym. We'll see what happens where when the time comes.\n
            I have another poem I wrote on that trip to the Bahamas; it will be hard to understand if you weren't there though.
            >>poem
            Da River
            Side to side we sway,
            the antithesis of Drake,
            quenching his thirst for revenge,
            to the privy without delay
            Bimini Bay, BS (06.23.24)<<`
