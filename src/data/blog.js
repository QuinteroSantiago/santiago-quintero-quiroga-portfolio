        I am tired... Very tired... Should never sleep less than 3 hours again. Not in a good mood :) BUT THINGS WERE FCKNG DONE. Now I can rest in peace.

        Pest that doesn't rest,
        screaming at my ear,
        There's nothing I dread more,
        Than that bitch I have to hear.

        Well well, a lot has happened since the last time I journaled. Just wrapped up this new haiku, so let's start from the end.
        Finally finished season 4 of GoT. It was magnificent, best season yet in my opinion. Can see the crack through the greatness though, as in Orson Lannister's story, no sense in it.
        Day at work was not so fruitful, not because of lack of work or trying, just one of those days that is hard to put two and two together. Morrow is a new day, new life, no worries.
        Both me and the lady tired, another sickness has preyed upon us. It is what it is.
        As for yesterday, I haven't gotten a clue as to what happened unfortunately, should've journaled to recall.
        The day before that one was soccer, I was extremely tired that day. Recalling all of these events now make me remember I have barely slept more than 4 hours each night. It is what is.
        Sunday Spain game was good, very good, the rise of a superstar, I worry the Catalans will destroy his career as they have with so many others. Hopefully, like Leo, he can be the exception, not the norm.
        And finally, how sad is the state of futbol on this side of the continent. Terrible game first of all, but the real issue is how terrible the US is becoming in terms of security. That stadium rush was a national embarrasament. How the hell are they going to host a WC in two years? And the assassination attempt makes it even worse.
        All in all, should journal more and actually follow the routine I have laid out in the website. 
        I am now going to add something.... Great, now I can't recall :)
        OOOOOOOO I remember, titling each page, will get on that.

        Went to the gym for a bit but more importantly, integrated the gym display function in the webpage. Think that might give me some motivation to start going.
        Was productive as hell this week so going to take a break from the poems and journaling today.

            Today is 711. Worked from the moment I awoke until now. But twas okay, very productive day. Just have a couple of things to wrap up for tomorrow thankfully and I should be done. I like finishing stuff.
            We are still watching GoT, season 4 is very good, loli was surprised by who killed Joffrey, she didn't expect that.
            I am feeling content, but have to code more, create more software, I'm finally starting to enjoy it throughly, time passes by flying when solving issues.
            Didn't go to the f*cking gym... Tomorrow's double day, I am going to read this tomorrow morning as well, it's in my mental todo list.
            Finally wrote something new today:
            >>poem
            Enduring

            Woke up at 0500 to charge the car for the lady. A lot of moving parts, lots of releases, lots of lines of code to look at, it was more of a merging and fixing day than building unfortunately. Not too bad though, fixed most things, some things are still broken. We finally saw the bastard Joffrey die, he finally had won as well, nice.
            As for yesterday, Spain won and I watched the game at juliet and henry's, or at least the second half. Twas fun, should do again. And I did end up working out, at least the jog to the place and back killed me. Didn't reaallyy watch either semifinal, these are both the losing teams for Sunday either way. Need to workout tomorrow, can't miss that since I didn't go today.
            Also, writing this late at night is no good for me, have too many thoughts scrambled here and there. Finished a deployment now so I can rest.
            My poems are also now clearly deteriorating as I'm running out of old material, will leave you with this 'masterpiece' I tried to write from my vast knowledge of japanese.

            Today will be cloudy all day.
            Will try to watch the Spain vs France game, work willing. Odds are slightly in favor of Spain (+170 vs +200), I predict a 1-0 win for them.
            Want to use my Gomu Planner app a bit more today to plan. I will have to review the logs at night to get the full benefits as well. I am writing this down so I will work out today, at least at my home gym. We'll see what happens where when the time comes.
            I have another poem I wrote on that trip to the Bahamas; it will be hard to understand if you weren't there though.

            This will be my first blog post, just want to post my thoughts here.
            I would like to journal daily, we will see how that goes. Blah blah blah blah, need to fill this up a bit, I will leave you with a poem I wrote a bit ago:
            >>poem
            Da Grey Beneath
            Blue black infinity,
            Shadows in your trenches,
            humanity's greatest fear,
            a trove of friendship
