It provided an Interactive Guide, Project Generator (Code Initializer), and a Testing Suite for the existing Spring Boot Services Infrastructure that existed within JPMC. The projectâ€™s goal was to make service deployment easy and make it simple to add documentation. We made this project API-driven with the purpose of having the flexibility to easily integrate it into other frameworks.
