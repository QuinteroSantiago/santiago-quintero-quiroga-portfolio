It provided an Interactive Guide, Project Generator (Code Initializer), and a Testing Suite for the existing Spring Boot Services Infrastructure that existed within JPMC. The projectâ€™s goal was to make service deployment easy and make it simple to add documentation. We made this project API-driven with the purpose of having the flexibility to easily integrate it into other frameworks. It also gave the option to completely overhaul the front-end for the engineers taking over the project.',

Once we determined the statistics most correlated to MVP, we used a Support Vector Classifier that predicted MVP with 99% accuracy.',
